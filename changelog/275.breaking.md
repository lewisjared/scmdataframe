Dropped support for Python 3.8 and relaxed requirements of pint and pyam-iamc

This has led to a number of follow up issues:

- documentation of our supported dependency versions ([#277](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/issues/277))
- moving to NEP29 ([#276](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/issues/276))
- a full review of dependencies ([#278](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/issues/278))
- need to test against development versions of upstream repositories ([#279](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/issues/279))
